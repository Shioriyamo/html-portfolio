<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, my name is Erica and I am highly interested in being a Full stack Web
  Developer. <br />
  Since I was a child I've always had a love for computers. Building a computer
  was not interesting to me, <br />but wondering how websites were built always
  interested me. <br />
  I've took some detours in my life and now I am back on the correct path. lol.
  I see a vision for myself. <br />
  I know I will be a top developer. I have amazing ideas I want to start putting
  these ideas into action. <br />
  I can't wait to show the world my creations! <br />Oh btw, I love to have fun
  when I create. A world with no fun is a dull world. I love to keep laughing
  and smiling no matter what comes against me.
</p>
