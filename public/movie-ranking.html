<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Terminator 2</h3>
<p>
  I love this movie because I like how the T1000 was relentless coming after
  John.

<h3>Friday</h3>
<p>
  Friday is a hilarious movie with Chris Tucker and Ice Cube. Some of the
  comments or quotes in the movies always have me cracking up.
